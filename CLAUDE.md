## Testing Documentation

When adding or modifying API tests, always update the following files:

1. **tests/TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Document each test with:
   - Test name and description
   - Parameter values used
   - Expected behaviors and assertions
   - Any fixtures or helper functions used

2. **tests/API_COVERAGE.md** - Update the API coverage matrix to reflect:
   - Which endpoints are tested
   - Test coverage status for each HTTP method
   - Any new endpoints or test scenarios added
